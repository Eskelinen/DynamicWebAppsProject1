# DynamicWebAppsProject1
Here is a simple To-Do list web app built using basic DOM scripting.
The app takes user input and inserts it into a table. The user can mark the tasks as done and remove them.
A counter below the table keeps track on how many tasks there are left to do.
All user input is saved to browser localStorage.
